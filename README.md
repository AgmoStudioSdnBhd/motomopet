# MotomoPets AR

MotomoPets is a Blockchain-powered Augmented Reality Pet created for Eid al-Fitr.

## Getting Started

Malaysian-based software company, Agmo Studio Sdn Bhd announces the release of a pet raising mobile application powered by Blockchain and Augmented Reality; MotomoPets. Released inline with the upcoming nationwide-celebrated Eid al-Fitri, more locally known as Hari Raya Aidilfitri, the application aims to encourage fun and interactive social interactions between friends and family during the upcoming festive season.

MotomoPets allows users to raise a themed pet, namely, a MotomoPet, every festive season by providing it love and blessing, which is represented via QR Code scanning and sharing between users. Each time a user scans a QR code of another user, his/her pet earns some blessings and in turn, grows a little. As the pet grows, it will eventually evolve to a higher phase, allowing it to access features such as wearing accessories.

### Blockchain supported system: 
The blockchain system supporting this application from the back provides fairness and transparency, particularly // In addition, the equipment randomisation (Gachapon) system is also powered by blockchain, which allows transparency in viewing the fairness of the system. The said system is essentially exchanging a sum of internal currency for a random piece of equipment for the pet.

### Augmented Reality Greeting Cards (AR Greeting Cards):
Another attractive point of MotomoPets lies in one of its AR functionalities. Can’t choose between sending an e-greeting card to loved ones over a physical AR supported one? MotomoPets brings the two together by allowing users to customise an e-greeting card with an AR experience for the recipient.
